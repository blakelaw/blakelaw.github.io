I am an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, majoring in mathematics with a concentration in data science. I have worked as a research intern at Kennesaw State University's mathematics department and as grader of several math classes at GT, including advanced statistics and partial differential equations. 

My current academic interests revolve around machine learning, natural language processing, data engineering, and data visualization. Outside of my academic interests, I love playing the piano, hiking, tennis, and geoguessr. If you have any exciting opportunities or questions, don't hesitate to email me at blakelaw at gatech dot edu.
