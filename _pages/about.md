I am currently an undergraduate at Georgia Tech, majoring in mathematics with a concentration in data science. 

I have worked as a research intern at Kennesaw State Universityâ€™s mathematics department and this summer I will be a data science intern at Perpay, a financial firm focused on providing credit to underserved communities. 

My current academic interests revolve around markets, machine learning, and public policy. Outside of school, I enjoy playing the piano, hiking, tennis, and geoguessr. If you have any exciting opportunities or questions, don't hesitate to email me at `blakelaw@gatech.edu`.
