I am an undergraduate student at Georgia Tech majoring in mathematics with a concentration in data science. I have worked as a research intern at Kennesaw State University's mathematics department and as grader of several math classes at Tech, including advanced statistics and partial differential equations. 

My current academic interests revolve around machine learning, natural language processing, data engineering, and data visualization. Outside of my academic interests, I like playing the piano, hiking, tennis, and geoguessr. If you have any exciting opportunities or questions, don't hesitate to email me at blakelaw at gatech dot edu.

Updates
======
* I am working on a [project](https://github.com/blakelaw/Cobb-Microregion) to identify cultural regions in Georgia that are smaller than a city -- which I have termed "microregions" -- through natural language processing and clustering analysis
* I am currently grading for [MATH 4261](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/4261) (Mathematical Statistics I) and [MATH 4347](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/4347) (Partial Differential Equations I) for the Fall 2023 semester
* Investigated the bias of NBA referees through propensity score matching and three other quantitative methods ([article](https://blakelaw.dev/portfolio/nba-referee/), [Github](https://github.com/blakelaw/Referee-Analysis)) 
* Created a method to [identify alternate accounts](https://github.com/blakelaw/Duplicate-Account-Finder) operating online through NLP and machine learning techniques
* Graded for [MATH 3215](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/3215) (Introduction to Probability and Statistics) and [MATH 3670](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/3670) (Probability and Statistics with Applications) in Summer 2023
* Interned at the [KSU Department of Mathematics](https://www.kennesaw.edu/csm/academics/mathematics/about/index.php) to research the efficiency of traffic flow in roundabouts, four-way stops, and traffic lights and created queueing models for each
